# Multi-Level Parking System (LLD)
An enterprise-grade, low-level design implementation of a multi-level parking lot. This system supports high-concurrency slot allocation, nearest-distance logic, and level-specific pricing using Java.

---
## 🚀 How it Works

The system follows a modular flow to ensure scalability and thread safety:

### 1. **Configuration (The Blueprint):** 
Using the ParkingLotBuilder, the client defines the physical structure: the number of levels, gates per level, and slots.

### 2. **Distance Mapping:** 
For every slot, a distance array is provided relative to every gate in the system. This allows the system to find the "nearest" slot regardless of which floor it’s on.

### 3. **Entry & Allocation:** 
When a vehicle arrives at a gate, the SlotManager uses the NearestSlotAssigningStrategy to find the closest available slot.

### 4. **Concurrency Control:** 
To prevent two cars from taking the same spot at the same time, we use AtomicBoolean operations within the Slot class to ensure "first-come, first-served" at a CPU level.

### 5. **Billing & Exit:** 
Upon exit, the BillingService calculates the fee based on the HourlyBillingStrategy. Pricing is determined by the specific slot's rate (allowing different levels to have different costs).

## 🛠️ Compilation & Execution

### **1. Compile**
```bash
javac -d out --source-path src/main/java src/main/java/com/snakeladder/Main.java
```

### **2. Run**
```bash
java -cp out com.snakeladder.Main
```

> **Note:**  
> The `-d out` flag keeps compiled `.class` files separate from source code.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Thread Safety:** 
Handled via java.util.concurrent and Atomic primitives.

### 2. **Strategy Pattern:** 
Easily swap out NearestSlot with CheapestSlot or Hourly with FlatRate billing.

### 3. **Builder Pattern:** 
Simplifies the "hectic" process of initializing complex infrastructure.

### 4. **Scalability:** 
Supports a virtually unlimited number of levels and gates.
